# Design

As described in the [_Tools_](tools.md) section, CATcher is an Angular application that is distributed both as a web and a desktop app. From a design perspective, there are no major differences between
both versions.

This page describes CATcher's design. As an Angular application, the different
views of the CATcher app are built out of **components**, and the content displayed on these
views is constructed from data provided by **services**. We describe the design of the views and services in the following sections.

## Views

There are only a few views accessible by the user, in each phase of the practical exam.
The diagrams below show how a user can navigate between the different views in various phases.
The diagrams also show which components are used to construct each view.


(Briefly explain how larger components like IssueTablesComponent / ViewIssueComponent are constructed
from smaller components / app state).

## Services
